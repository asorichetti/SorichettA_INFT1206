    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p> Dear Eileen, <br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <br></p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br></p>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    <p> Please let me know if that is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
