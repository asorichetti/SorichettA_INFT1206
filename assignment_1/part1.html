    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
    <p> Dear Eileen, <br><br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. 
    I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <br></p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the 
        beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br></p>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li style="margin-left:30px">Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    <p> Please let me know if that is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>
    
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
        You seem line an intelligent, dedicated researched, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
        Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect of performance of funk bassplayers at temperaturs exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title = "Hyper Text Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, 
        required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
